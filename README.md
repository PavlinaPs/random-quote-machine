## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- jQuery

### What I learned

This is my first time using jQuery and API. I learned a lot.

### Continued development

 I am aware, that my project is not very good performance-wise, unfortunately as of now I don't know, how to optimize it. I'm also not sure if I'm supposed to use AJAX with jQuery or I could use async await and cry-catch syntax as I did.

### Useful resources
